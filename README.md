# Get started with Python in Google Colab

This Google Colab Notebook is provided for a workshop held by IEEE Young Professionals, "Google Colaboratory, Reinforcement Learning using Python" @ Montreal on 23 March 2021 in two-part. 
In the first step, we covered the basics of using Colab, and in the second part, we covered an introduction to reinforcement learning and wrote Q-learning code.
This notebooke is covered the first part by this subjects: 
We covered the following subjects in this file:
