# Google Colaboratory plus Reinforcement Learning using Python

This Google Colab Notebook is provided for a workshop held by IEEE Young Professionals Montreal on 23 March 2021 in two-part. 
In the first step, we covered the basics of using Colab, and in the second part, we covered an introduction to reinforcement learning and wrote Q-learning code.
This notebooke is covered the first part by this subjects: 
We covered the following subjects in this file:

# IEEE Hands on RL using Python
- Introduction to Colab, creating your first notebook, settings, GPU usage, themes
- Mounting Google Drive to Colab, uploading and accessing files from drive
- Importing different libraries in Colab, like Numpy, Tensorflow, PyTorch, Pandas, installing missing libraries such as OpenAI gym
- Handling images in Colab using matplotlib, and handling data using pickle
- OpenAI gym Sample and Forms & Tables Sample
